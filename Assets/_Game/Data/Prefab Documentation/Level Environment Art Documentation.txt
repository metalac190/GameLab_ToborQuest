## Environment Artists Only

### What is Included?
All environment art that does not include any colliders.
There will be designated set designers for setting up the environment art (One artist per level).

### How will development work?
Environment art should not be set up until after Alpha
It should match the Level Blockout as closely as possible so that the level design does not change.
Any art that the player should collide with needs to go in the Level Obstacles Prefab. Talk to Level Design about adding it.
