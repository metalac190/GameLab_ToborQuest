## Level Design and Environment Artists

### What is Included?
All Lights and Post-Processing effects.

### During Alpha
Lighting will be set up by Level Designers as a rough first pass.

### During Beta
The Art team (Mainly the set designers) will take over and adjust lighting to better fit the artistic vision of the Art Lead.

### How to Light in URP
A singular mesh can only have up to 6-8 lights TOTAL at once. Any more than this will cause flickering and look bad.
Keep the Range of lights as low as possible, while achieving the desired look.
