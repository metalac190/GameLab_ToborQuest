## Narrative Only

### What is Included?
All Dialogue Triggers

### How will development work?

On the Dialogue Trigger Prefab, you'll find the Invisible Trigger Component. Create an entry into the Event by pressing the plus button and drag the dialogue asset you've created for this trigger into it.

Where it says "No Function", click it and find Dialogue in the dropdown. Pick "RunDialogue ()". This will run the dialogue asset when the player passes through the trigger.

If you wanna change the size of the trigger, change the Box Collider Scale Settings not the Transform of the object!
