## Level Design and Environment Artists

### What is Included?
Level Obstacles are all objects with colliders that are placed in or near the player's path.
This is complimentary to the Level Blockout prefab.

### How will development work?
This should be finalized by Alpha so that Artists can start adding art around the obstacles, and maybe to the obstacles themselves.
There should be constant communication between the Set Dressers (Artists) and Level Designers with this prefab.

### How will Art work with this prefab?
Think of the level obstacles as All Art that needs a Collider.
Talk with Level Designers before moving objects in this area. Feel free to decorate objects how you see fit.
