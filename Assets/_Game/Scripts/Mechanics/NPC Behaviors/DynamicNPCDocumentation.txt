# Dynamic NPC Waypoint Documentation

This is just a quick user guide on how to use the waypoints for the [Dynamic NPCs]

## References

Before you begin editing the waypoint positions, it is important to check the [Dynamic NPC] in the scene to make sure a set of [Waypoints] is referenced. If a Dynamic NPC doesn't reference a set of [Waypoints], this will not work.

## How To Use

Just use the hierarchy to move around the waypoints underneath the main [Waypoints] gameobject to your desired location. Feel free to duplicate any and arrange them however you'd like.

If you press the (Reset Waypoint Position) Button, all waypoints will be reset to the position of the [Waypoints] gameobject.

If you press the (Random Waypoint Scatter) Button, all the waypoints (except for the last one which will stay in the original position) will be scattered randomly with a max range of 20 units. You can change this by changing the (Random Scatter) variable.

The (Waypoint Size) variable allows you to adjust the size of the gizmos that represent the waypoints. This won't really affect anything except for how the gizmos look.

### Quick Note:

Do not move the last waypoint. You could if you wanted to, but by keeping it in it's original spot, you can keep track of the origin point of the [Waypoints] gameobject.
