## Level Design Only

### What is Included?
Level Mechanics are any moving or collidable objects

### How will development work?
Once programming has a basic setup of the mechanic as a Prefab, Level Designers will add those prefabs under this prefab.
Level Designers should set the positions and relations of level mechanics all under this prefab.
All Level Mechanics should be included by the Alpha deadline, though adjustments can be made during Beta.

### How will Art be Implemented?
Once the art for any specific level mechanic is complete, the level designers or programmers will take the artist's prefab and add it to the level mechanic's prefab.
This should update the art for all of that same level mechanic, assuming prefabs are used correctly.

### What if I need to reference an object outside of this prefab?
There should be no reason to ever reference any object outside of this prefab. This includes the player and level blockout.
The programming team should set up a way for level mechanics to know of the players position or anything else required, without having a direct reference.
If a level mechanic needs to affect objects in the level blockout, those objects should probably be in this prefab instead.
